The geezer has some chops as a producer for sure and is gonna be in demand from artists galore pretty soon once the word gets out.'</em> <br/> - Music Republic Magazine</p>
        <p>Somewhere between Bonobo and Flume; eclectic electronic producer Ohmfield exists. Since 2017 he has worked tirelessly to cement his position in the UK contemporary electronic music scene and is showing no signs of slowing down. Combining a vast array of electronic, alt-pop and hip-hop influences; his music is consistently described as being unqiue while still having mainstream appeal. His most recent project is a direct response to the pandemic and the struggles he has faced over the past two years.</p>
        <p>He has seen a wide variety of successes over the past couple of years, particularly in the blog scene where he has received considerable attention from publications like <strong><a href="https://acidstag.com/2022/05/newcomers-5/" target="_blank">Acid Stag</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://www.stereofox.com/ohmfield-rain-over-zurich/" target="_blank">Stereofox</a></strong>, <strong><a href="http://www.obscuresound.com/" target="_blank">Obscure Sound</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://musicrepublicmagazine.com/2018/08/undiscovered-ohmfield/" target="_blank">Music Republic Magazine</a></strong>. These features have helped him rack up an impressive amount of attention through HypeMachine with several of his singles reaching the top 5 and recently 'Burnout' making it to the #1 spot. Aside from blogs, Ohmfield continues to gain attention on Spotify and other streaming platforms racking up over 200,000 collective streams and numerous offical playlist placements. Within his hometown of London he has received several radio plays and strives to connect with as many London based artists as possible.</p>
        <p>Ohmfield's newest project is a collection of 4 singles relating to the pandemic and the troubles he and the rest of the world have faced. After losing loved ones, a relationship breakdown and long periods of unemployment; he found the best way out of this was to sit down and create. The first single 'Burnout' dealt with unemployment and the burnout he experienced trying to work as many jobs as possible while also trying to remain creative. 'Back To Life' focuses on the more personal subject of his relationship breakdown throughout lockdown, specifically the moment he returned to their shared flat to find that she had left.</p>
